# MXNet resnext vs Keras resnet

* In food image classification, resnext was excellent, 
but since there are many similar images in face classification, 
we need to compare which is superior.

# Comparison method

* The number of each idle image is assumed to be the same
* 80% of images for Training
* 20% of images for Test (validation omitted)
